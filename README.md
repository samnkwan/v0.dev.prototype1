These are the prompts to v0.dev used to create this project

1.

I need to create a simple Reactjs application or website. It should use functional components and typescript and react styled components. The main page should be a basic list of tasks. There should be a login and logout button at the top. This should show a moda to allow login which will be just simple local storage based right now in the absence of an authentication provider. Once logged in the user should be able to edit, add and delete to the list. All of this should be persisted in local storage.

2.

Can you change it so that you can see tasks without login in? So without login in you should be able to view the tasks but not edit. Only when you login should you be able to manage.

3.

Can you remove the task statuses? For the sake of simplicity we don't need them. Also no need for filtering on active and completed. For the login, ensure it takes an email and password. Ensure the only user that can login is test@test.com with password as 'admin'
